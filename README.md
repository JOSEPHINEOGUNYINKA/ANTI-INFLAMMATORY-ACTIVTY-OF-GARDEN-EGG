## INFLAMMATION 
Inflammation is a complex biological response of vascular tissues to invasion by an infectious agent, antigen challenge, physical, chemical or traumatic damage.

It is a protective response of the body to eliminate the initial cause of cell injury (diluting, destroying and neutralizing the harmful agents), remove the damaged tissue and generate new tissue It involves a well-organized cascade of fluid and cellular changes within living tissue. It is essential for homeostasis

## NSAIDs
Some drugs such as aspirin, indomethacin and diclofenac are used to reduce inflammation. They are called **NSAIDs** (*Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs*). They possess anti-inflammatory action for treating several inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, but prolonged use of NSAIDs has some associated adverse effects such as nausea, fluid retention, bleeding and gastric lesion.
This is why new drugs from medicinal plants that can be used to reduce inflammation and are devoid of these side effects are being researched on as alternatives to NSAIDS

## GARDEN EGG
Garden egg they are commonly consumed almost on daily basis by both rural and urban families. The family is one of the largest and most important families of vegetable grown for their edible form.  Depending on the type, either the leaves and young shoots or the fruits or both are eaten; they may be consumed raw, dried, cooked or in salad form. They can also be boiled or fried as ingredient of stews, soups and vegetable sauces. 
The eggplants form part of the traditional sub-Saharan African culture. Their uses in indigenous medicine range from weight reduction to treatment of several ailments including asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal catarrh, skin infections, rheumatic disease and swollen joint pains, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, constipation, dyspepsia.. 
Some observations and oral reports though, show that people with high consumption of garden egg have relief in arthritic pains and swelling. Lack of scientific data to support these claims prompted this study which was therefore aimed at assessing the possible anti-inflammatory activity of garden egg (_S. aethiopicum_) in both acute and chronic inflammatory. This natural “defence” process brings increased blood flow to the area, resulting in an accumulation of fluid. That is Inflammation is a pattern of response to injury, in which cells and exudates accumulate in irritated tissues and tend to protect from further damage.
In this study, analyses were carried out on the indigenous eggplants, S. aethiopicum and their anti-inflammatory activity was checked.
